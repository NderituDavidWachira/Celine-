	<h3>Our Store's History</h3>
	<p>Curtis Grocery Store was founded by a couple of team players who wanted to start an online store in which one could be able to access the different types of grocery products they needed in one place. We all know that vegetable and fruit shopping can be a hard task especially when you have to go through the products being sold to ensure they are fresh. Curtis group made it easy to do your gropcery shopping since one can sort through the products online and order them or visit any of the curtis grocery stores branches near them and access the items. Our store has shown consistent improvement eversince with more and more customers commending our good work and others joining our curtis stores finance groups.</p>
